# Optimization
Training model is about:
- formulate the loss function
- search the optimal model paramete to minimize the loss function, but with billions of parameters and data, the optimization is really very expensive.

# Ideas used in traing
Gradient desent: start with some (w,b), keep changing w,b a bit to reduece the cost function until the cost function settles at or near a minimum.
